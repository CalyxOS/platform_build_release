# For now, as we figure out exactly how flagging will work, please send all
# reviews to this directory to joeo, with the others as backups for emergencies.

# As we build out the tooling and guardrails:
#   - More OWNERS, including around the world coverage.
#   - More clear policies will be made for adding new build flags, and
#     the expectation that most flags will be aconfig flags and settable
#     at runtime will become more firm.
#   - The build_config and aconfig directories will be managed
#     directly by gantry.
