Even with our split.\n\nThe patches we picked and refer to here are from the \u00272024-10-01\u0027 section.\n\nIt does open a whole other discussion wrt other devices / coming months, but at least for this, \u00272024-10-01\u0027 would be the most accurate for all devices.\n\nWe don\u0027t necessarily need to solve it this month, but it\u0027d be good to start the conversation at least.",
